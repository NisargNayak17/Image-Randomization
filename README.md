# Image-Randomization

This project is a simple responsive web application where users can interact with randomly displayed images. Users can click on images to perform animations, randomize the displayed images manually or automatically, and set a custom refresh interval for the images.

## Features

- **Random Image Display**: Upon loading the page, three images are displayed randomly from a predefined set of images.
- **Clickable Images**: Clicking on an image triggers an animation and resets the timer for automatic image refresh.
- **Manual Randomization**: Users can manually randomize the images using a button.
- **Custom Refresh Interval**: Users can set a custom refresh interval between 500 and 10,000 milliseconds.
- **Counter & Timer**: A counter displays how many times the images have been refreshed, and a countdown timer indicates the time left until the next automatic refresh.
